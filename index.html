      <p> Greetings, viewer of my webpage. My name is Jay and I'm thrilled that you're here. I am a professional coder in the making, and today we're gonna ask you a couple questions to see how well you know me...even though you probably don't.</p>
      <p> Currently, I'm in school. But when I'm done here, I hope start a career as a real programmer. Here's a couple things I'm looking forward to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Writing all the codes!</li>
        <li>Making all the moneys!</li>
        <li>Not being a bartender!</li>
        <li>Not working on Holidays!</li>
        <li>Carrying my laptop with me everywhere I go! Yippee!</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Not quite as relevent, but here's a couple things I'm better than my girlfriend at:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Wearing sweatpants</li>
        <li>Having a 6 pack (of beer)</li>
        <li>Every video game made, ever</li>
      </ol>
